# Dotfiles

These are my dot configuration files.  I use this repo to maintain these files and make it easy to pass them from system to system.

Symlink to these files from your home directory, to get portable, updatable dotfiles.

The symlink-dotfiles.sh script is available to automatically create symlinks for the dotfiles in this directory.  By default, it does not overwrite whatever you may have in that directory; you will need to delete any dotfiles in your home directory that you wish to autolink.
